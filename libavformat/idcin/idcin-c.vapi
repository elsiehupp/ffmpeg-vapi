/**
 * @file
 * id Quake II CIN file demuxer by Mike Melanson (melanson@pcisys.net)
 * For more information about the id CIN format, visit:
 *   http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~timf/
 *
 * CIN is a somewhat quirky and ill-defined format. Here are some notes
 * for anyone trying to understand the technical details of this format:
 *
 * The format has no definite file signature. This is problematic for a
 * general-purpose media player that wants to automatically detect file
 * types. However, a CIN file does start with 5 32-bit numbers that
 * specify audio and video parameters. This demuxer gets around the lack
 * of file signature by performing sanity checks on those parameters.
 * Probabilistically, this is a reasonable solution since the number of
 * valid combinations of the 5 parameters is a very small subset of the
 * total 160-bit number space.
 *
 * Refer to the function idcin_probe() for the precise A/V parameters
 * that this demuxer allows.
 *
 * Next, each audio and video frame has a duration of 1/14 sec. If the
 * audio sample rate is a multiple of the common frequency 22050 Hz it will
 * divide evenly by 14. However, if the sample rate is 11025 Hz:
 *   11025 (samples/sec) / 14 (frames/sec) = 787.5 (samples/frame)
 * The way the CIN stores audio in this case is by storing 787 sample
 * frames in the first audio frame and 788 sample frames in the second
 * audio frame. Therefore, the total number of bytes in an audio frame
 * is given as:
 *   audio frame #0: 787 * (bytes/sample) * (# channels) bytes in frame
 *   audio frame #1: 788 * (bytes/sample) * (# channels) bytes in frame
 *   audio frame #2: 787 * (bytes/sample) * (# channels) bytes in frame
 *   audio frame #3: 788 * (bytes/sample) * (# channels) bytes in frame
 *
 * Finally, not all id CIN creation tools agree on the resolution of the
 * color palette, apparently. Some creation tools specify red, green, and
 * blue palette components in terms of 6-bit VGA color DAC values which
 * range from 0..63. Other tools specify the RGB components as full 8-bit
 * values that range from 0..255. Since there are no markers in the file to
 * differentiate between the two variants, this demuxer uses the following
 * heuristic:
 *   - load the 768 palette bytes from disk
 *   - assume that they will need to be shifted left by 2 bits to
 *     transform them from 6-bit values to 8-bit values
 *   - scan through all 768 palette bytes
 *     - if any bytes exceed 63, do not shift the bytes at all before
 *       transmitting them to the video decoder
